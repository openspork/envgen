    "# Measuring Impedence\n",

    "My plan is to build a pre-amp circuit to provide a better signal for (a) trigger detection, (b) input into VCA for volume boost.\n",

    "But first... I'm curious to try and measure the output impedence of a borrowed guitar (B.C. Rich Mockingbird). \n",
    "\n",
    "To measure impedence, I plan to use a voltage divider method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on some preliminary research:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Guitars with passive pickups typically have 10k-20k ohm impedence. \n",
    "* For voltage divider, best to choose a resistor value close to the target impedence, e.g. 10-20k.\n",

    "I'll connect the circuit with a resistor inline:\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "I used the RMS function of my scope to compare voltages at A and B and after some trial and error ended up using a 100k立 resistor and measuring an impedence of 200k立 (!). I don't know why it is so high."
